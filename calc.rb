# my solution was using 52 weeks instead of 365 days, not sure why I thought of
# 52 weeks first instead of 365 days.

# how many hours are in a year?
# 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 52 weeks/year

# one way
hours_in_a_year = 24 * 365
# answer: hours_in_a_year = 8760

# minutes in a decade?
# 60 minute/hour, 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 52 weeks/year, 10 years = decade

minutes_in_a_decade = ((((60 * 24) * 7) * 52) * 10)
# answer: minutes_in_a_decade = 5241600

# your age in seconds

# 60 seconds/minute, 60 minutes/hour/ 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, 52 weeks/year
my_age_in_seconds = (((((60 * 60) * 24) * 7) * 52) * 27)
# answer: my_age_in_seconds = 849139200

# author is 1,160 million seconds old, how old is he?
# 36.88 ~ 36 or 37 years old
# when he first started writing 800 million seconds he was
# 25 years old
